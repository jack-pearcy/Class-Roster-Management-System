Created a C++ application to manage and manipulate a university’s student roster data as part of a platform migration project. Implemented two primary classes—Student and Roster—to parse, store, and process student records. Features included reading and parsing data, calculating average course completion times, validating email formats, and filtering by degree program. Demonstrated strong understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and console-based application development.
